## 🔑 Key Features

- **Layered test architecture**  
  A clean separation of responsibilities across TestNG suite → Test Classes → Steps (business layer) → Page Objects → AbstractComponent → Core Utilities → Selenium WebDriver → Allure → CI/CD. This structure keeps the framework maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend.

- **Page Object Model with shared UI abstractions**  
  Each page is represented by a dedicated Page Object, while common UI logic (explicit waits, interaction helpers, synchronization) is centralized in `AbstractComponent`. This eliminates duplication and ensures consistent behavior across the entire test suite.

- **Robust WebDriver lifecycle management**  
  `DriverManager` and `WebDriverFactory` handle browser creation, configuration, cleanup, and environment‑specific settings. This improves test stability and makes switching browsers or enabling headless mode effortless.

- **Rich Allure reporting**  
  Full integration with Allure (TestNG + AspectJ) provides step‑level reporting, screenshots on failure, retry history, attachments, and clean visual summaries. Reports are highly readable and ideal for debugging and stakeholder visibility.

- **Automatic retry logic with full diagnostics**  
  A custom `RetryAnalyzer` and TestNG listener automatically re‑run failed tests once. Allure records each attempt separately, including screenshots and logs, making flaky tests easy to identify and analyze.

- **Flexible configuration system**  
  `ConfigReader` merges system properties with `config.properties`, allowing dynamic control over browser type, headless mode, base URL, and other settings without modifying code. Perfect for multi‑environment execution.

- **CI/CD ready (GitHub Actions)**  
  A dedicated workflow runs tests on every push/PR, caches Maven dependencies, and uploads Allure results as artifacts. The project is prepared for further automation such as publishing reports or running tests in parallel.

- **Readable, scenario‑focused tests**  
  The Steps layer expresses business actions in a human‑friendly way, making tests easy to understand during reviews and suitable for collaboration with non‑technical stakeholders.

## 🧪 How to Run Tests

1. Install dependencies

mvn clean install

2. Run tests

mvn test

3. Generate Allure Report

allure serve target/allure-results

## 📊 Allure Reporting

Each test step is annotated with @Step

Automatic screenshot capture on failure

Attachments for logs and diagnostics

Results stored in target/allure-results

## 📊 Sample Allure Report

Below are example screenshots generated from the framework to illustrate how Allure presents test execution, failures, and retry attempts.

### Overview

### Failed Test Details

### Retry History

## 🔁 Retry Logic

The framework includes a custom RetryAnalyzer that automatically re‑runs a test once if the initial execution fails.

The retry mechanism is fully integrated with TestNG listeners

Allure records every test attempt, including retries

The report clearly shows:

which attempt passed or failed

full diagnostics for each attempt (screenshot, page source, console logs)

a complete execution timeline for debugging

This approach provides visibility into potentially flaky scenarios and demonstrates how the framework handles failures, captures detailed diagnostics, and presents retry history in Allure.

The Allure report included in this project contains an example test that illustrates how retry attempts are displayed and how failure details are captured.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is stored in: src/test/resources/config.properties

Loaded via ConfigReader class.
